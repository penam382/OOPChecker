In progress: OOPChecker

The idea for this project is to create an OOP Checker tool that analyzes Java code for adherence to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal is to detect common bad practices, anti-patterns, and issues such as:

- Long Methods
  
- God Objects
  
- Escaping References
  
- Large Classes
  
- Tight Coupling
  
The tool will take Java code as input and provide feedback on potential issues that violate good OOP design. The primary focus is on ensuring code quality, modularity, and maintainability by helping developers write cleaner and more efficient code.
